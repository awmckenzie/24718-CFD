Assignments from 24-718 Computational Fluid Dynamics at Carnegie Mellon University in Fall 2021.

HW1: Finite difference approximations of the derivatives of functions

HW2: FTCS explicit, FTCS implicit, and Crank-Nicolson solutions to 1D Couette flow

HW3: Crank-Nicolson and ADI solutions to the 2D heat (diffusion) equation

HW4: Upwind and Lax-Wendroff solutions to the 1D linear advection (wave propagation) equation, periodic boundary conditions

HW5: Explicit solution to the 2D advection-diffusion equation, iterative methods to solve the Laplace equation (Point-Jacobi, Gauss-Seidel, SOR)

HW6: Solution to the 2D lid-driven cavity flow problem with the streamfunction-vorticity formulation of the incompressible Navier-Stokes equations

CFD.yml is the anaconda environment with the necessary packages to run the code.
